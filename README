grabbb
readme file

 1. description

    grabbb is a very fast banner grabbing program, which will test an entire
    range of ip addresses on a single or multiple ports, and if successful
    it will capture the first line the remote daemon sends.

    this can be useful for statistical purposes.

    note this can be used for protocols such as ssh, ftp, smtp, nntp, ...
    but not for things such as telnet, which is not as "simple" as you
    may have thought.


    have fun,
      scut of teso
